```

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. If you donâ€™t have them, please download and install from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/).

After installation, you can check the [Releases section](https://github.com/Kenenshinasu143/agents/releases) for the latest version. Download the files and execute them as needed.

## Usage

Once you have everything set up, you can start creating your AI agents. Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started:

1. **Create an Agent**: 

   You can create an agent using the provided template.

   ```javascript
   const agent = new AI_Agent({
       name: "MyAgent",
       task: "Answer questions",
       language: "English"
   });
   ```

2. **Deploy the Agent**:

   Use the following command to deploy your agent on Cloudflare.

   ```bash
   cloudflare deploy MyAgent
   ```

3. **Test Your Agent**:

   After deployment, you can test your agent by sending requests.

   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-cloudflare-url.com/ask -d '{"question": "What is AI?"}'
   ```

### Example Workflows

You can create workflows to automate tasks. Hereâ€™s a basic example of a workflow that retrieves data from an API and processes it:

```javascript
const workflow = new Workflow("DataProcessing");

workflow.addStep(async () => {
   const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
   const data = await response.json();
   return processData(data);
});

workflow.run();
```
